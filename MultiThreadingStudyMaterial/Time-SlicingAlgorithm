There are multiple thread in given application 

lets assume we have multiple thread in our applications 

so we can create as many thread in any given process we want 

in generic case let assume there are k number of thread in the application


there is huge question how cpu is going to handle these threead 


how these threads are going to be executed :

Time Slicing Algorithm 

some how the CPU has to deal with all the thread in the applications 


we are assuming that there are only a single processor 


modern computer there are huge number of available cpus 


time slicing operations 


lets say there are two thread that is there application , that needed to handle using a single cpu 

so it will handle first thread short amount of time and then second thread , then the first thread like that 

while the cpu is executing the first thread the second thread has to wait 

this is how multiple threads are heandled with the help  of single processors 

usually modern computers has multiple processors or multiple proceesors cores 


when there are multiple processors or multiple processors core 

then thread can be handled simultaneously by using different ptocessors or different cores 


if there number of threads greater than number of cores then time slicing algorithm is going to be used
