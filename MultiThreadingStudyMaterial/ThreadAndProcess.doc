By default , Programming languages are sequential 

which means they execute the command one by one 

line by line basis 

lets say we have main method in java 
----------------------------------

public static void main(String args[])
{
method1();

method2();

method():

}

by default 
Single thread application this operation are executed one by one 

the problem is that time consuming application will freeze the entire applications 

lets say we need to download a huge dataset from the internet  , while dealing with machine learning algorithm 



multi threading  is to separate multiple time consuming task 


lets say we are dealing with stock market application and application is dealing with downloading data from web let say we are downloading data from Yaoo finance 

then it generates time series model 

what is the problem over here , it will take 2-3 mintues to fetch the data 

so what will happen the application in the user computer is going to be feeze 


solution is we need to use multi threading for this problem , we need to use separate thread 

lets take the example copying directory in windows , operating system does 


Multithreading is the ability of CPU  to run multiple process or thread 

what is process and what is Thread 

Thread and Processes are independent sequnces of execution 

lets talk about one by one 

Process is instance of programme 

this is the fundamental unit of working 

for example when you open distinct process or system they are all process 

operating system assign distinct register , stack memory and heap memory to all processes 

we have given process and inside the process we have register , stack memory and heap memory 


this resources is associated with given process 

in java we can create process using ProcessBuilder Class

in the command line if you type tasklist it is going to show all the  processes running


Every Single process has PID , process identification number 

we are here not dealing with processes , creating a processes is quite expensive , because we have to allocate register , we need to allocate heap memomry 

we need to allocate stack memory 

so it is quite expensive to create new process 

the processes in operating system form directed graph , ecey single process has so called parent process 

whenever we create  process , we need to handle parent process as well 

 it is quite expensive 
 
 Thread is light weight process 
 
 Thread exist within given processes
