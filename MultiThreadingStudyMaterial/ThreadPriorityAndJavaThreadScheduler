in this lecture we are going to talk about Thread Priority 

when there is a given process there are several threads 


lets assume there are 5 threads with in a given process 

these threads are executes by central processing unit 

a single central processing unit can execute a single thread at a time 

this is why THread Scheduler came to picture which is part of Java virtual machine 


Thread scheduler will decide which thread will be executed by Central Processing Unit 


essentially Time slicing algorithm is handled by Thread scheduler 

if we have 5 threads or multiple threads , in what order central processing unit 


this is why we need to talk about Thread Priorities 

------------------------------------------------------------

we can assign the priority number from 1 to 10  to the thread 

MIN_PRIORITY  : 1 

MAX_PRIORITY : 10 

------------------------------------------

the minimum priority is one and the maximum priority is 10 


the default priority is 5 

-------------------------------------

if we dont define the priority for given thread it will have the default priority 5 



thread with higher priority will be executed before thread with lower priority 

-----------------------------

if we asssue that the all the thread has same priority value 

theese thread  are going to executed in FIFS manner : first in first server manner 

------------------------------------------


this is why thread scheduler has a queue of abstract data type :


THread scheduler can use time slicing alogorithm , in order  to execute multiple threads 


if we assume all the threads having the same priority then we have to assume that 

thread scedhuler is using time slicing algorithm to run the first thread for small amount of time , next the second thread for amount of time , 

then the 3 rd thread  will be executed for small amount of time and so in 
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 what will happen if there are some threads with higher priority value 
 
 -----------------------------------
 
 higher priority threads will get executed before lower priority threads 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 it may depends on OS 
 
 it may also happen that thread with low priority will not get the chance to be executed at all : this is called Thread starvation 
 
 
 -----------------------
 Java virtual machine and Thread scheduler will try to avoid the starvation situation by running lower priority thread when required
