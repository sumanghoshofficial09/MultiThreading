we dont have to wait for time consuming applications, using time slicing algorithm the processor will give chance to other waiting process, 

we can design better responsive application - we can do several operations concurrently 

we can achieve better CPU utilization 

By default every java application is single threaded 

we can utilize more CPU cores with multiple threads

we can utilize multiple cores , can run multiple thread so that we can improve performance 

if there are multiple processing unit every thread will be executed in one processing unit 

java is not going to any thread , we have to create threads explicitly
