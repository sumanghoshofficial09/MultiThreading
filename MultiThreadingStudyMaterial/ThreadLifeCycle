in this lecture we are going to talk about THred Lifecycle 

there are 4 life cycles associated with given Thread 


create a new thread : New State 

every single thread is New State untill we call the start 


whenever we instantiate a new Thread 
this is called new State 

when we call start method , new Thread is in Active Thread 


when we were talking about time slicing algorithm there are multiple Thread 

the CPU has to handle 

there are two sub states Runnable and Running 

lets say thread is active state 

that is means THread is currently in Runnable state 

it is not handled at this moment because CPU is busy with other thread 

this is runnable state , thread is ready to be executed 

when thread got chance to run by the CPU , it is in running state 

there is so called blocked or waiting state 

whenever we call join method , wait method or sleep method 

essentialy we thread has to wait for other thread to finish , this is blocked or waiting state 


when the thread is in waiting state , it is not consuming any CPU cycles 


ThreadScheduler will notify the Thread 

this is blocked or waiting state when a given thread is waiting for another thread to finish its 


job 


we are going to talk about producer and consumer problem with the help of wait and notify 

method 


Finally there is Terminated Stage :


when the given thread has finished its task
